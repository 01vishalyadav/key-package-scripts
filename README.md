This page summarizes the process of creation of Key Package

        - key-pkg-ver-1 should be used for XR releases 76x and 77x
        - key-pkg-ver-2 should be used for XR releases 78x and above

## Why is Key Package needed.

The end goal of Key Package infrastructure is to provide user a secure mechanism to install Customer signed software or a secure way for customer to send Customer Signed Consent Requests. Key-package is a conduit used to securely onboard public/verification keys of 3rd party non-cisco customers, onto XR devices.


## What is Key Package

Key package is a CMS file (Cryptographic Message Syntax - RFC5652) which is digitally signed by the Ownership Certificate (OC), and having a payload. The payload is a tar of the customer/3rd party keys which are to be onboarded onto the system, along with a configuration file config.txt which contains details on what actions to be performed with the key.

## Pre-requisites - Establish Device Ownership

A customer has to establish device ownership, as part of which the Ownership Certificate (OC) will be installed into hardware secure storage (TAM) of the customerâ€™s router. Without device ownership established, one cannot install 3rd party key packages onto the system. 

Confirm device ownership is established by issuing command: "show platform security device-ownership"
