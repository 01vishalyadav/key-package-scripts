This page summarizes the process of creation of Key Package


## Why is Key Package needed.

The end goal of Key Package infrastructure is to provide user a secure mechanism to install Customer signed software or a secure way for customer to send Customer Signed Consent Requests. Key-package is a conduit used to securely onboard public/verification keys of 3rd party non-cisco customers, onto XR devices.


## What is Key Package

Key package is a CMS file (Cryptographic Message Syntax - RFC5652) which is digitally signed by the Ownership Certificate (OC), and having a payload. The payload is a tar of the customer/3rd party keys which are to be onboarded onto the system, along with a configuration file config.txt which contains details on what actions to be performed with the key.

## Pre-requisites - Establish Device Ownership

A customer has to establish device ownership, as part of which the Ownership Certificate (OC) will be installed into hardware secure storage (TAM) of the customerâ€™s router. Without device ownership established, one cannot install 3rd party key packages onto the system. 

Confirm device ownership is established by issuing command: "show platform security device-ownership"

## Creating Key Package

### To Add a GPG Key:
create_kpkg.py -o ADD -t ALLOWED_LIST -u TESTG -k GPGKEY -i ./test.gpg -p ./oc-single.pem -r ./oc-single-priv.key -f ~/test.add
Key package generated at: ~/test.add

### To remove a Key:
create_kpkg.py -o DELETE -t ALLOWED_LIST -u TESTG -k GPGKEY -i ./test.gpg -p ./oc-single.pem -r ./oc-single-priv.key -f ~/test.del
Key package generated at: ~/test.del

### Creating Key Package Bundle
Lets say ~/test1.add and ~/test2.add needs to be bundled into a new key package.

bundle_kpkg.py -l ~/test1.add ~/test2.add -p ./oc-single.pem -r ./oc-single-priv.key -f ~/bundle.key
Key package Bundle generated at: ~/bundle.key

### Verifying Key Package - Tools
verify_kpkg.py -p ./oc-single.pem -f  ~/test.del

The various argument's description is as below:
o - Type of operation (ADD/DELETE)
t - List to operate on (ALLOWED_LIST/REVOKED_LIST)
u - Name of key (key will be stored with this name in XR router)
k - Key type (X509/GPG)
i - Key to be added
p - Signing public key
r - Signing private key
f - Output file

## Key Package in XR

Once the key-package is created following the above stepse, it can be applied on an IOS-XR box. When the key-package gets successfully 
applied, the keys part of the key-package gets stored securely in the IOS-XR box

### Installation 

platform security key-package customer disk0:/test.add

### Show commands

show platform security key-package customer allowed-list location NAME

show platform security key-package customer revoked-list location NAME
